A fan shroud designed for the Ender 3 V2 (with support for a BL/CR touch module as well) designed to replace the poor performing original fan shroud.

It features space for 2 5020 Axial blower fans, providing with an enourmous amount of part cooling.
It also changes the original 4010 axial fan meant for the heatsink cooling to a much quieter 5010 axial variant.

It uses little metal rods of about 3.9mm to hold most of the parts togethor through a friction fit. But you can very well use normal bolts (M3 or M4, whatever would work), or even print the metal rods out of plastic as well. You are also welcome to use the STL file and enlarge/reduce the holes as neeed.
It uses a very lightweight design, to reduce weight wasted on plastic and also features a very cool looking front "vent" shape. Besides looking cool, this also ensures that the fans blow in the corrent directions and the air doesn't mix about forming vortexes which only reduce performance. The block below it also ensures that the frame is as sturdy as possible and isn't flimsy.
Unlike the previous "Juggernaut" design, it also maintains a 4.5mm distance from the bed on the lowest point. This reduces the chance of any collisions and so ensures that no step skips happen because of the shroud catching on printed objects like the "Juggernaut" tended to do.
